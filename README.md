# Library-Database
A project that allows libray administrators to keep track of books that people borrow.

  - The application reads from a database of library books, and each book should has properties like name, author, genre, and     availability (checked out or not)
  - Users (library administrators) can sort/search for books based on criteria, main one being name and genre
  - Users can set the status (availability) of the book (books by default are set to available and NOT checked out)
  - Users can add/delete library books
